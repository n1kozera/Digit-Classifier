# Digit Classifier: Draw, Submit, and Recognize!

## Overview

"Digit Classifier: Draw, Submit, and Recognize!" is an interactive web application that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to recognize handwritten digits from user input. The project demonstrates the power of deep learning in real-time digit classification and provides an engaging platform for users to interact with machine learning technology.

## Features

- **Real-Time Recognition**: Users can draw digits on a canvas, and the model provides instant predictions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application is designed to be intuitive and accessible, making it suitable for users of all ages.
- **Interactive Feedback**: Users receive immediate feedback on their drawn digits, enhancing the learning experience.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for developing the CNN model.
- **TensorFlow**: The deep learning library used to build and train the CNN for digit recognition.
- **Gradio**: A Python library that allows for easy creation and deployment of user interfaces for machine learning models.
- **MNIST Dataset**: The dataset used for training and evaluating the CNN, consisting of 70,000 images of handwritten digits.
